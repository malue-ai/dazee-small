# TailwindCSS 样式规范

## TailwindCSS and DaisyUI Rules

- Use TailwindCSS utility classes for styling
- Avoid custom CSS unless absolutely necessary
- Maintain consistent order of utility classes
- Use Tailwind's responsive variants for adaptive designs
- Leverage DaisyUI components for rapid development
- Customize DaisyUI components only when necessary
- Define and use design tokens in tailwind.config.js

## Prompt Generation Rules

- Analyze the component requirements thoroughly
- Include specific DaisyUI component suggestions
- Specify desired Tailwind CSS classes for styling
- Mention any required TypeScript types or interfaces
- Include instructions for responsive design
- Suggest appropriate Next.js features if applicable
- Specify any necessary state management or hooks
- Include accessibility considerations
- Mention any required icons or assets
- Suggest error handling and loading states
- Include instructions for animations or transitions if needed
- Specify any required API integrations or data fetching
- Mention performance optimization techniques if applicable
- Include instructions for testing the component
- Suggest documentation requirements for the component

## General Component Creation Guidelines

- Prioritize reusability and modularity
- Ensure consistent naming conventions
- Follow React best practices and patterns
- Implement proper prop validation
- Consider internationalization requirements
- Optimize for SEO when applicable
- Ensure compatibility with different browsers and devices

## General Rules

- Enable strict TypeScript (strict: true in tsconfig.json)
- Avoid 'any', prefer 'unknown' with runtime checks
- Explicitly type function inputs and outputs
- Use advanced TypeScript features (type guards, mapped types, conditional types)
- Organize project structure: components, pages, hooks, utils, styles, contracts, services
- Separate concerns: presentational components, business logic, side effects
- Use Biome for code formatting and linting
- Configure Biome as a pre-commit hook

## TypeScript Rules

- Enable all strict mode options in tsconfig.json
- Explicitly type all variables, parameters, and return values
- Use utility types, mapped types, and conditional types
- Prefer 'interface' for extendable object shapes
- Use 'type' for unions, intersections, and primitive compositions
- Document complex types with JSDoc
- Avoid ambiguous union types, use discriminated unions when necessary
